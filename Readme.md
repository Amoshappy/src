# GoCollaborate
## What is GoCollaborate?

## The Idea Behind
GoCollaborate absorbs the best practice experience from popular distributed services frameworks like [✨ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), [✨Dubbo](http://dubbo.io/) and [✨Kite](https://github.com/koding/kite) that helps to ideally resolve the communication and collaboration issues among multiple isolated peer servers.
